								I received my B.A. in Chemistry from Kenyon College in 2004.  After a brief foray into industry, I entered graduate school and earned a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Chicago.  This work was performed under the guidance of Steven J. Sibener, and focused primarily on the use of helium atom scattering to characterize the structure and vibrational dynamics of thin organic films.
							</p>

							<p>
								I started as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with S. Alex Kandel at the University of Notre Dame in 2014, where I investigated the self-organization of small organic and organometallic molecules at the vacuum-solid interface using scanning tunneling microscopy.  I joined Clarkson University as an Assistant Professor in 2018.

							<p>
								My research group conducts research to identify the impact of chemical structure, growth environment, and molecule-substrate interactions on the formation of supramolecular structures at the vacuum-solid interface.

						<p>
							I received a B.A. in Chemistry along with minors in Computer Science and Business from SUNY Plattsburgh in 2018. I joined the Brown Lab in August of 2018 to persue a Ph.D. in Surface Chemistry. My work is focused on the design and construction of a variable-temperature ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (VT-UHV STM), as well as the functionalization of silicon surfaces to investigate the self-assembly of supramolecular products at the liquid-solid interface. When I'm not in the lab I enjoy playing volleyball with other Clarkson graduate students.

						<p>
							I received a B.S. in Chemistry along with a minor in Forensic Science from SUNY Oswego in 2018. Later that year I joined Clarkson University in pursuit of a Ph.D. in Chemistry under the guidance of Ryan Brown, where my work is focused on the design and construction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) that operates under ambient conditions to investigate the impact of molecular growth environment on supramolecular products at the liquid-solid interface. When I'm not in the lab I enjoy playing on the Clarkson Graduate Volleyball club team, as well as exploring the North Country area.

						<p>
							I received my B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering from Aachen University of Applied Sciences in 2020. Within the last year of my studies I was working in Prof. M. J. Sch√∂ning group at the Institute for Nano- and Biotechnologies at my university in the field of biosensors. Together with his help I was able to perform a semester abroad at Clarkson University in 2019. In collaboration with Prof. E. Katz and Prof. R. D. Brown and his group, we studied on silicon surfaces and how to use surface chemistry to enhance the performence of sensing surfaces. In my upcoming master's program I will continue my study on biosensors and attempt to contribute to advancement of biosensors.
